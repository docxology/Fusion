Keep the FUSION header from wrapping when the terminal is narrow. The `MiniLogo` and tab pills had Yoga's default `flexShrink: 1`, so the row's collective content overrunning the width was being absorbed by shrinking every child — including FUSION, which then wrapped to two lines. Pin all fixed-content header children to `flexShrink={0}`; the trailing flexGrow filler absorbs slack instead.
