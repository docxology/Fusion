Add node routing policy enforcement: when a task is routed to a node that is offline or unhealthy, the project's `unavailableNodePolicy` setting controls whether execution is blocked (task stays in todo) or falls back to local execution. Supports `defaultNodeId` project setting for pinned default nodes and per-task `nodeId` overrides. Routing decisions are logged to task activity for visibility.
