Remote access (Tailscale) overhaul: the auth/scan URL now uses the live `https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net/` URL captured from `tailscale funnel` instead of a constructed `http://<hostname>:<port>` from a configured label, so QR codes lead to a working public endpoint. The hostname label is no longer required (engine validation and the Settings UI both dropped it; `tailscale funnel` never used it). QR codes are now rendered with the `qrcode` library — previously the SVG was just the URL drawn as text — and a new `format=terminal` returns ASCII QR for the TUI. The Tailscale readiness parser now waits for the line containing the URL before flipping to `running`, fixing missing-URL captures. Dashboard polls remote status while `starting`/`stopping` so state updates without reopening the modal. The TUI shows a global `● tunnel` indicator with URL in the header when running, and `Ctrl+Q` opens an ASCII QR overlay anywhere in the app.
