Fix the mobile QuickChat panel layout when the iOS keyboard opens. The panel now stays anchored to the visible viewport (no off-screen drift on a refocus after the keyboard was dismissed), the soft keyboard reliably comes up the moment the FAB is tapped (a stealth input claims focus inside the user gesture so iOS opens the keyboard even before the real composer is enabled), the panel snaps back to full height immediately on blur instead of trailing the keyboard slide-down, and the model name in the header pill collapses to a provider icon when it would otherwise overflow.
