Fix TUI header overflow when a remote tunnel is configured. Between 100 and 175 columns the remote URL was pushing the left edge (logo + tabs) offscreen; the remote info now lives in a flex-shrinkable, right-justified slot that truncates instead of overflowing. Also gives the QR overlay a solid background so it no longer renders transparent over the underlying TUI.
