Fix vitest test-harness regressions that masked correct production code as failing tests:

- Restore `util.promisify(exec)`/`util.promisify(execFile)` to resolve with `{stdout, stderr}` inside the test child-process guard. The previous wrapper dropped the `[util.promisify.custom]` symbol, so awaited `execAsync` resolved to a raw stdout string and broke any test or runtime path that destructured the result (cli `init` git commit flow, core git-remote project-name detection, engine cron-runner / restart / worktree-pool clusters, etc.).
- Allow cheap CLI introspection invocations (`--version`, `--help`, `which …`) through the AI-CLI block so the dashboard's claude availability probe can tell the truth about the local system. Session-launching invocations (e.g. `claude -p …`, `droid chat`) still throw.
- Give SIGTERM'd subprocesses a short grace period in the per-test guard's `afterEach` before flagging them as "left running", fixing a race where production code that correctly killed the child was reported as leaking it.
- Add a test-only `__registerMissionInterviewSessionForTest` helper so SSE replay/buffer tests can exercise the stream manager without spinning up a real AI agent.
- Fix executor mock to simulate real step-transition semantics (forward moves persist; in-progress regressions on done/skipped steps get rejected) so the new `persistedStatus`-aware response text in `fn_task_update` is exercised correctly.
- Fix the iOS last-resort path test in `useMobileKeyboard` to actually reach the `gap < 16 && viewportShrink ≥ 16` branch by setting `vv.offsetTop > 0`.
- Convert `await import("../server.js")` in 14 dashboard route tests to static imports so first-test latency in those files drops from ~2–5s to <200ms.
