/**
 * Claude Code skill installation for Fusion projects.
 *
 * When pi-claude-cli routes the model through Claude Code, pi's own skill
 * injection is bypassed (pi-claude-cli only forwards systemPrompt + AGENTS.md).
 * Claude Code instead auto-loads skills from `<project>/.claude/skills/<name>/`
 * and `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`. To make the fusion skill available inside
 * Claude Code sessions, we symlink the shipped `skill/fusion` directory into
 * each project's `.claude/skills/fusion/`.
 *
 * Entry points that call installFusionSkillIntoProject:
 *   - `fn init` (packages/cli/src/commands/init.ts)
 *   - `fn project add` (packages/cli/src/commands/project.ts)
 *   - POST /api/projects (packages/dashboard/src/routes.ts)
 *   - serve.ts startup reconciliation (packages/cli/src/commands/serve.ts)
 *
 * All call sites are guarded by isPiClaudeCliConfigured() so users who don't
 * route through Claude Code never see `.claude/skills/` appear in their repos.
